# About The Project
My passion for coding dates back to my high school days, where I started teaching myself how to code using various online resources such as FreeCodeCamp. As I honed my programming skills, I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge and expertise in the field. Thankfully, I was accepted into the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), where I was able to gain a comprehensive education in the intricacies of computer programming and software development.

Throughout my time at UIC, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and assignments that challenged my problem-solving abilities and expanded my understanding of coding principles. To showcase my progress and skills, I created a personal portfolio that includes both the projects I completed independently and those I worked on while completing my degree. Now, I am proud to say that I have successfully graduated from UIC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree and am eager to continue developing my skills as a professional programmer.
